## ðŸ“„ Abstract

Having a baby changes everything, starting with the moment a lady is pregnant. Combating morning sickness, scheduling doctorâ€™s visits, remembering to take your prenatal vitamins, tracking your quickly growing baby, keeping a check on the mental health of the mother â€” thereâ€™s so much to keep tabs on.
Moreover, it's also important for parents to keep a reminder of the child's growth after birth that can potentially help them in identifying any disease before it gets worse.

Talking about rural areas, people don't even have access to good healthcare facilities keep aside the concept of having timely medication and care. Going deep into this makes us realize that there is a need for an application that can cater to not only pregnant parents but also their children (even after birth!).

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

* Making an application that can help the parents in both in pregnancy and post-pregnancy phase.

* For the pregnancy phase, the features could include -

    * Keeping a check on the mother's diet - maintaining a record of a healthy diet depending upon the month of gestation. This should also make sure that the child gets proper nutrition in each of its growth stages.
    *  Yoga assistant - a virtual yoga assistant that can suggest the best yoga for mothers and guide them to avoid any kind of injury or loss.
    *  Books & music recommendations that vary y month of gestation. This would also include dedicated books and music libraries specially designed for mothers.
    *  Virtual appointment scheduling with the doctors.
    *  Reminders for medicines, checkups, and weekly/monthly appointments with the doctors.
    *  Chat feature for mothers, where they can connect with other mothers and share their journey with each other.
* For the post-pregnancy phase, the features could include -

   * Vaccination schedule for the child
   * A ML learning model that can predict the growth of the child via his age, height, and weight.
   * Age-wise nutrition recommendation for the better growth of the child.
   * Doctor support for immediate health discrepancies.
   * Personal virtual yoga assistant for both the mother and child.
